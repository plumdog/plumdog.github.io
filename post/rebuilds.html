        <div class="blog-post-content"><p>To rebuild a large system is an awful lot of work. In my view, either
a rebuild or more likely just a lot of "housework" should be scheduled
in every year or so. If nothing else, staring down the barrel of
starting everything over crystallises several things, like evaluating
which sections will take longest, which utilities are particularly
valuable and what tools and features are on offer elsewhere, but you
don't currently have. In most cases, I think a rebuild is a mistake,
but evaluating one definitely isn't. With reasonable likelihood, you
should be able to add the new features yourself and spend half the
amount of time having a cleanup as you would rebuilding.</p>
<p>More tangibly: we use a venerable (read "old") web framework. It has
warts and things I dislike and we have written plenty of ugly code on
top of it. But there's so much good stuff too. We understand its ways,
and -- with a little force and a little swearing -- we can make it
understand us. There's plenty I would like to change about it. But I
think, at least in this case, I would rather make those changes that
start over.</p>
<p>However a side project I have <em>does</em> need a rebuild. (Flat PHP,
anyone?) Why a rebuild? Because it has no direction, no personality,
nothing that would be missed. Every moment I stare at its code, I feel
my braincells evaporating. Also, its not very big.</p>
<p>I think I subscribe more to the idea of continual and vicious
evolution of a codebase. Replacing your ORM or templating system might
be a lot of work, but it keeps you focussed and
driven. Philosophically, I see giving the code two new heads and three
new handles to be both very practical and pleasingly cathartic.</p></div>
