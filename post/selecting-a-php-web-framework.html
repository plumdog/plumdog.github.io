        <div class="blog-post-content"><p>Selecting a web framework can be a somewhat daunting task. Its not too
bad if what you're building is a one-off, standalone application that
isn't too big. Unless you need to do something very left-field, every
half decent framework will do at least "fine" or better. There will be
forms and databases and validation and html views. You know the drill.</p>
<p>But what about a long term project that you and your colleages need to
continually develop for until the end of time (or rather, when the
next rebuild happens or when you're all out of a job)? Clearly it is
foolhardy to jump on the bandwagon of the latest cool-kid in
framework-town. Longevity now counts for a lot. You need not only to
do the standard stuff and do it well, but you need to get a feel for
how you will deal with problems that you haven't been presented with
-- though plenty of motivating examples are very useful -- and someone
will always ask for something weird.</p>
<p>I think this raises some interesting points about making decisions
more generally, specifically about technical requirements. It would be
awesome if we could make this choice without having to fall back on
instinct. I'm not saying that instinct is all you have -- you can
quickly start to rule out non-contenders that are clearly well off the
pace -- but unless you are (by some measure) very fortunate, several
will look like a good bet, and the things that will differentiate them
are only a long way down the line, and only the very lucky can give
the options a full road test.</p>
<p>And this is the position we are currently in: Symfony vs Zend vs
Phalcon. Symfony wins at modularity and features, Zend wins at
business support and Phalcon wins at performance. Which one will it
turn out that we really do need most? Its not that we require at least
"seven" performance and Symfony only has "five", how much is enough?
Nor even which features are available -- we can always build a feature
if it doesn't exist, but will the time lost be worth it versus the
gains we made by eschewing the possibility of having it already</p>
<p>In a domain where we feel so comfortable knowing that our decisions
are often so strongly evidence-based, when making a decision that will
impact on the next how-many-years of development, it feels so
unnerving to let gut-feeling have any sway. Though there's comfort in
the fact that, for our current quandary at least, every option would
be a massive improvement.</p>
<p>Except Zend.</p></div>
