        <div class="blog-post-content"><p>A world where all code was written and the frozen, and all extra
features were just built entirely 'above' that code would mean that
all you needed to do was manually test the code you added, confirm it
works in each path of logic and be really very sure that it was
correct. However, this world is a) not a pleasant dev world and b) not
a realistic one. Code always needs to be altered, extended or
improved. That's a given.</p>
<p>Let's suppose its you that's changing something existing. You change
something. Did you break all the other stuff that relied on that?
Probably. Tests are the only remedy. Change some code, improve an
algorithm in the backend, adjust the way a process happens in a
frontend, rewrite a database query to be more efficient. If you have
tests you're safe, and you <em>feel</em> safe. Boss tells you a client is
trying out that code, you feel confident, there's no fear of the
unknown things you never considered. Look at your spec, look at your
tests -- they should be fairly easy to match up. System needs to be
able to do something? Ok, lets write the test for that. Even if a bug
does get reported, write a test that fails, code the fix until the
test passes, ship it. Then just be confident. Your tests give you the
armour of confidence.</p>
<p>I thought of the analogy of armour based on my -- sadly ongoing --
dual life doing dev as well as support. In a support role, your armour
comes from confidence in your knowledge of what you will be asked
questions about, or what to do even if you don't know. Your course is
clear and you have your armour of knowledge. Shipping code that isn't
tested feels a lot like answering the phone to someone who you know is
going to ask you something you don't know anything about and you don't
know where to turn. Don't be so foolhardy as to go without such a
vital comfort, for the sake of, if nothing else, sanity.</p></div>
