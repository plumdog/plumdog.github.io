        <div class="blog-post-content"><p>This is not so much advice, or general observation -- more just an
admission of a mistake I make repeatedly.</p>
<p>I often find myself wanting to start something new, but in an area I
don't know much about. For example: a game, a JavaScript library, a
desktop application, anything in C. My bad habit is to get stuck down
the rabbit hole of the packaging and non code things, when what I
should be doing is getting enthused about actually building the
thing. Just start writing the code, and get a proof of concept. Tackle
the interesting problems, and the ones that will actual determine the
success of my project.</p>
<p>I think this lines up with my belief that progress through a project
should be as breadth-first as possible. By which I really mean,
totally <em>not</em> be depth first. (I'm feeling another post coming on
about the nature of the tree of problems for a project.) Put simply, I
mean to solve the problems as simply and idiomatically as possible and
get them all done and functioning -- or just put them off if you can
-- before pushing on to iron out the deeper wrinkles.</p>
<p>My packaging problem is an example of this. Don't worry about
distributing your Python game, or package.json files, or bundling GUI
toolkits, or makefiles -- get something working, and trust that you'll
have built it in such a way that if you need to swap something out or
rewrite a chunk, then you'll be able to.</p>
<p>Premature optimisation is also an example of this. Don't start solving
problems until you know you need to solve them.</p>
<p>So next time, just start coding.</p></div>
