<p>Pretty much regardless of where you are in your programming journey,
you will be learning things -- I think that's much of the appeal --
but I want to think here about the things that you're learning early
on. I refer to these as "mechanics" because the aren't really what we
think of as programming, they don't do anything cool and they don't
add features. They're bookkeeping.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Indenting -- Its not there as some annoying chore. Its there to make
  the logic of the code that you've written clear both to yourself
  and to anyone else looking at your code. Hopefully you're using an
  editor that can do this for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Naming -- This problem never really goes away, but make them clear,
  make them consistent and make them more than one letter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Planning -- This definitely never goes away, but start early. Where
  maybe later on we spend more time making bigger, architecture style
  planning decisions, early on spend your time writing down what
  functions you will need to write. Work out what your common chunks
  of logic that deserve their own function and work out what things
  need to trigger which other things. Draw a diagram, a flow chart,
  whatever helps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Version Control -- Another thing that you should start using
  early. This one is not super relevant to my idea of "mechanics", but
  it will save you one day. Make sure you don't have a "if only I had
  used git" story, but rather a "thank goodness I was using git, and
  you should too" story.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Googling -- Got an error message? Awesome! That's the best thing a
  computer can do to tell you exactly what to do. What its saying is
  "fix this thing, if you don't know anything about it, then the
  internet will". Search and search well.'</p>
</li>
