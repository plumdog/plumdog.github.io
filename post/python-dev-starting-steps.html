        <div class="blog-post-content"><p>Mostly, https://docs.python.org/devguide/ is a good resource. However,
one thing it did not mention which had me stumped was that if you get
an error like <code>Failed to build modules: time</code>, then you need to run
<code>make distclean</code>.</p>
<p>Also, Python dev uses <code>hg</code>, which looks to have the same basic
structures as git. Branches, tags, etc, but still has a cognitive
overhead for me. Though I believe they are moving it to GitHub which
will <em>definitely</em> encourage me to contribute more, or at least reduce
the impediment for me to contribute.</p>
<p>However, I have found that the procedure with each bug/issue/ticket is
a little confusing. Perhaps there's a page I need to read properly,
but it seems slightly unclear to me. There is a page explaining things
about the issue tracker, but - in very open source style - is: here
are the things, here is what they mean. But no actual explanations of
the questions you might actually have or example workflows. For
example, "my" ticket is <a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue25195">https://bugs.python.org/issue25195</a>, but I
don't know if there's something I need to do next. Oh well, I think
everything is currently correct, and I'm waiting on someone else
looking it over and making a decision about it.</p></div>
