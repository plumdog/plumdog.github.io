        <div class="blog-post-content"><p>I recently read a book all about trees. This made me realise that I
could identify a concerningly small number of trees, especially given
how generally outdoor-savvy I would like to consider myself. I used a
couple of online tree identifiers but was frustrated by those that
don't let you enter the features that are obvious, but rather follow
the flow-chart question-answer pattern.</p>
<p>So I wrote my own. I probably could have found a better one if I'd
kept hunting (or paid for an app) but this seemed like something I
would learn something from building. Also, it doesn't require any
faffy deployment stuff, I can just deploy some HTML and JavaScript to
GitHub pages and the job's done.</p>
<p>I should possibly have used this as a chance to make something with a
fancy JavaScript framework, but I didn't. But it did mean that I did
some more fiddly JS stuff. It's not like the tricky bit was
manipulating the HTML. The tricky bit was fiddling about with the
data. I ended up writing quite a few classes which I <em>think</em> I'm OK
with. Python tends to push me gently away from writing classes unless
I think they are <em>definitely</em> better than the alternative, purely
because it is so easy to make code readable without them. But in
languages that I find to be much less readable, classes give a nice
way of making code more readable thanks to encapsulation. In addition,
I just used jQuery and Bootstrap (because doing DOM stuff with
JavaScript without jQuery is yucky, and making any web page look OK
without Bootstrap is faffy).</p>
<p>The finished article is <a href="http://www.plumdog.co.uk/tree_identifier/">hosted
here</a> and hopefully it will
evolve over time to get more extensive and easier to use.</p></div>
